# Summary
The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted every nation on earth and been dealt with through countless methods and strategies. Investigating where countries succeeded and where they failed can provide valuable information on resource management, prioritization, planning, and organization. Canada and the U.S may seem similar at first glance, however, they differ economically, socially, and politically. This project compares the two countries regarding how they dealt with the pandemic and where certain damages were dealt. Note that the documentation and report are written in plain language to provide easy understanding and comprehension.
