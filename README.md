# Canada v.s. USA COVID-19 Analysis
**Summary:**
The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted every nation on earth and has been dealt with through countless methods and strategies. Investigating where countries succeeded and where they failed can provide useful information on resource management, prioritization, planning, and organization. Canada and the U.S may seem similar at first glance, however, they are  different economically, socially, and politically. This project compares the two countries regarding how they dealt with the pandemic and which one took the better approach.
